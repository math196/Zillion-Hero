# ⚔️ Zillion Hero

Zillion Hero is a minimalist idle RPG where you collect heroes, level up, fight endless waves of enemies, and discover synergies — all in a text-based interface inspired by classics like Trimps and Idle Ant Farm.

> 🧠 Designed to be simple to play, but with deep progression systems — with **no images**, just pure data-driven strategy.
